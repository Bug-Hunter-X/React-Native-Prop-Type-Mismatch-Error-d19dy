# React Native Prop Type Mismatch

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native development: prop type mismatches.  A third-party component is expecting a specific prop type, but it receives something incompatible.  This often leads to runtime errors and unexpected behavior.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file shows a scenario where a component from a hypothetical third-party library receives an incorrect prop type. This results in an error message from React Native.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file presents a solution by correctly providing a compatible prop type.  Proper type checking and data handling are crucial to prevent this kind of issue.  The example showcases how to ensure the prop is a valid React element before passing it to the component.
