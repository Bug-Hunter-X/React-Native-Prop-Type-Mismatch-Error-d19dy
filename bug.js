This error occurs when using a third-party library that expects a specific type of prop and is not compatible with the value you are providing. This often happens when integrating components from different libraries or when handling data that doesn't perfectly match the component's expectations.

**Example:** A library may expect a prop to be a React node (e.g., `<Text>`), but instead receiving a string or a number.  Another possibility is that your component expects a specific structure to be passed as a prop, like an object with a certain property, and is instead receiving something else.  This also happens often when dealing with asynchronous data, before it has loaded correctly.

**Code Example (Bug):**
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import MyThirdPartyComponent from 'some-third-party-library';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <View>
    <MyThirdPartyComponent myProp="This is a string" />
  </View>
);

export default MyComponent;
```

Assuming `MyThirdPartyComponent` expects `myProp` to be a React node,  this will cause an error because the component receives a string instead of a valid React element.
