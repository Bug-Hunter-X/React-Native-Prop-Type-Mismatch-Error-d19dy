The solution involves ensuring that the prop passed to `MyThirdPartyComponent` is a valid React node.  This might involve transforming the data before passing it as a prop or conditional rendering to handle cases where data isn't available yet.

**Code Example (Solution):**
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import MyThirdPartyComponent from 'some-third-party-library';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <View>
    <MyThirdPartyComponent myProp={<Text>This is a React node</Text>} />
  </View>
);

export default MyComponent;
```

This corrected version passes a `<Text>` component (a React element) as the value of `myProp`, which addresses the prop type mismatch.  Always carefully review the documentation of third-party libraries to ensure you provide props of the correct type.
